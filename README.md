# BabySegway

This project is done by Yichun Zhao and Isha Singh Le Xue.

Segway is a two-wheeled vehicle designed to be self-balancing. When it is pushed, it moves in the direction of the force applied. Using this mechanism, the user can control the segway by leaning forward or backwards to make it move in the same directions. A handlebar is also installed for the user to turn by changing the speed of one wheel.

In order to detect whether the Segway should move forward or backwards to balance itself, the gyroscope and accelerometer are used. The gyroscope measures the angular speed of the movement while the accelerometer measures the acceleration with respect to the Earth. It is also known as the gravity which provides information on the tilt of the vehicle. Based on these data collected, the Segway is programmed to respond in order to balance.

In this project, we made a “Baby Segway”, a mini self-balancing robot without any steering using the two sensors, motors and different softwares such as Arduino for coding the Baby Segway, and LibreCAD for designing to laser-cut the robot.
